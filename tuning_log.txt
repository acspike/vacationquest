Baseline:
    with the original configuration 
    a single siege reported just over 2000 transactions/sec against a single nginx
    2 sieges running simultaneously report just over 1000 trans/sec each
    against haproxy a single siege performed similarly
    but 2 sieges were able to achieve just over 1300 trans/sec each


after changing nginx worker_processes to match the cpu core count at 1 also
raising worker_connections to 4096 to accomodate for fewer threads
context switches dropped by approximately half (or more) without significantly 
affecting the observed performance.
